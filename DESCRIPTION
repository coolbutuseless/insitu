Description: Using by-reference semantics, functions in this package are crafted to 
    modify the input objects in-place and avoid allocating new memory.  By avoiding 
    memory allocations (and the associated garbage colection these require), operations 
    performed by-reference can be faster than those performed with R's default 
    copy-on-modify semantics.
